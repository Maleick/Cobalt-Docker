  key_links:
    - Exception approval requires repo admin + code owner sign-off.

<objective>
Define and document the governance exception and reconciliation workflow for Phase 6.

Purpose: satisfy `GOV-04` and `AUD-02` by producing a deterministic emergency exception process with ownership, evidence, and closeout controls.
Output: exception workflow artifact with authorization model, TTL/scope enforcement, and reconciliation checklist.

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Authorization model requires repo admin + code owner.
- [ ] Exception scope and TTL controls are explicit.
- [ ] Reconciliation checklist includes owner sign-off and SLA.
- [ ] Escalation path exists for reconciliation SLA breach.
- [ ] STATE reflects post-plan verification readiness.

<success_criteria>
- `GOV-04` and `AUD-02` are fully represented in a deterministic exception workflow contract.
- Exception lifecycle is auditable from approval through closeout.
</success_criteria>
