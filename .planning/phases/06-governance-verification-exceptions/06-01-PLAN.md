<objective>
Define and document the governance verification procedure for Phase 6.

Purpose: satisfy `AUD-01` by creating a deterministic, reproducible CLI/UI verification workflow for protected branch governance.
Output: verification procedure artifact with evidence standards and local reproduction commands.

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Verification procedure artifact exists.
- [ ] CLI canonical rule is explicit.
- [ ] Evidence bundle requires command output + screenshot mapping.
- [ ] Discrepancy handling is deterministic.
- [ ] STATE reflects progression to 06-02.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- `AUD-01` is satisfied at procedure-contract level.
- Verification process is reproducible, auditable, and aligned to locked evidence rules.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-governance-verification-exceptions/06-01-SUMMARY.md`
