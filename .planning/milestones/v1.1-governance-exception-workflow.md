# v1.1 Governance Exception Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow governs emergency exceptions for protected branch controls with least-privilege approvals and auditable closure.

## Lifecycle

1. Request
2. Approval
3. Execution Window
4. Reconciliation
5. Closure

## Request Intake

Each exception request must include:

- incident/reference ID
- target branch (`master` or `release/**`)
- single referenced change set (PR/commit range)
- reason for exception
- requested start/end time
- requesting operator identity

## Approval Policy

Approval requires two-person authorization:

- one repo admin approver
- one code owner approver

Approval validity is limited to the exact branch and change set captured in the request.

## TTL and Extensions

TBD.

## Reconciliation and Closeout

TBD.
