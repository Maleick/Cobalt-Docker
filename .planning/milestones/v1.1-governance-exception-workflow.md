# v1.1 Governance Exception Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow governs emergency exceptions for protected branch controls with least-privilege approvals and auditable closure.

## Lifecycle

1. Request
2. Approval
3. Execution Window
4. Reconciliation
5. Closure

## Request Intake

Each exception request must include:

- incident/reference ID
- target branch (`master` or `release/**`)
- single referenced change set (PR/commit range)
- reason for exception
- requested start/end time
- requesting operator identity

## Approval Policy

Approval requires two-person authorization:

- one repo admin approver
- one code owner approver

Approval validity is limited to the exact branch and change set captured in the request.

## TTL and Extensions

Default exception TTL:

- 4 hours maximum from approval timestamp.

Extensions:

- require fresh two-person re-approval (repo admin + code owner)
- must include updated end time and rationale
- cannot expand branch scope or change-set scope beyond original request

## Reconciliation and Closeout

Reconciliation must complete within 24 hours of exception use.

Required reconciliation evidence:

- request reference and approved exception window
- branch target and change set actually used
- resulting governance state verification references
- discrepancy notes (if any)

Required sign-off:

- repo admin
- code owner

Escalation:

- if reconciliation is still open after 24 hours, escalate to repository governance owners and mark as non-compliant until closed.
