# v1.1 Governance Verification Procedure

## Purpose

This procedure defines reproducible governance verification for protected branch policy controls.

## Prerequisites

- Access to repository settings for verification.
- Access to CLI tooling used for governance checks.
- Access to capture UI screenshots for corroborating evidence.

## Branch Targets

- `master`
- `release/**`

## Canonical Verification Policy

- CLI command output is canonical when CLI and UI differ.
- UI screenshots are corroborating evidence and must be linked to CLI outputs.

## Verification Steps

1. Verify protected target scope exists for:
   - `master`
   - `release/**`
2. Verify required checks are configured exactly as:
   - `runtime-reliability / syntax-checks`
   - `runtime-reliability / shell-regression-suite`
   - `runtime-reliability / secret-scan`
3. Verify review-governance controls remain present:
   - required approving reviews
   - stale review dismissal
   - required conversation resolution
4. Record CLI output for each target and control group.

### CLI Verification Commands (canonical source)

- `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/master/protection`
- `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/release%2F%2A%2A/protection`
- `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/rulesets` (when rulesets are in use for corroboration)

Expected outputs should include protected-target entries and required-check/review-governance fields.

## Evidence Template

For each verification run, capture:

- verification timestamp (UTC)
- operator identity
- protected target (`master` or `release/**`)
- CLI command run
- CLI output excerpt or output file reference
- UI screenshot path/reference
- corroboration note linking screenshot to matching CLI output
- pass/fail result

Minimum evidence bundle rule:

- Command output evidence is mandatory.
- UI screenshot evidence is mandatory.
- Each screenshot must map to the same target and verification window as the CLI evidence.

## Discrepancy Handling

TBD.
